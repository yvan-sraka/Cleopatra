# Cleopatra

_Micro virtual environment for [YeAST](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/YeAST)_

## What's that?

Cleopatra let you work on a shell where YeAST alias the commons tools you defined.
This is needed when you want to use YeAST inside a complex runtime structure like, typically, a web framework!

YeAST will be called in place of your standard interpreter without the shebang on top of your files.
Interpreters should always take input as the first positional argument and write the output on standard output.

**e.g.** You can aliases python like that:

```shell
cleopatra add python
```

It will create inside `.cleopatra` subfolder (think it would be nice to add to your repository version source control), a `python` file which looks like (it could diverge on your machine):

```shell
YEAST_CONTEXT=/anaconda3/bin/python yeast $@
```

Aliases are just shell scripts and hackable by design, you can add pre and post steps on them to customize your micro-virtual environment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Get YeAST binary from source:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yvan-sraka/YeAST/master/install.sh -sSf | sh
```

### Build

You need an [Haskell build environment](https://www.haskell.org/downloads) on your computer, then just:

```shell
ghc cleopatra.hs -o cleopatra
```

You can also download an executable directly on the [release page](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/cleopatra/releases) of the repository.

### Usage

```shell
cleopatra <COMMAND>
```

#### Flags

- `-h`, `--help` Prints help information
- `-V`, `--version` Prints version information

#### Commands

- `add <program>` Alias YeAST to be call instead of `<program>` inside virtual environment
- `remove <program>` Remove alias set for `<program>`
- `glue` Enter the virtual environment by opening a new shell where `./cleopatra` folder is in `PATH`
- `unglue` Exit the virtual environment without leaving the currently opened shell
